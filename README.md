# DRIVE LAB FASTEXPORT Project Version 1

## Usage Details:
    This repo contains code and datasets for the University of Guelph DRiVE lab and integrations with SCANeR Studio. 
    A warning that some file names are hardcoded into the scripts, so they may not work unless they are present on the operating device.

    To open the configuration manager, run the export.exe

## Scenario Configuration:
    In the Main script of the simulation, right click on the top line of the script. Navigate to "Insert Include".
    Then search for the file path "C:\OKTAL\SCANeRstudio_1.6\data\GUELPH_DATA_1.6\script\include" and select fastexport.inc.
    This will set up the simulation to record the data from the configuration file
